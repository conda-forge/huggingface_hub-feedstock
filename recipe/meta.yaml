  summary: Client library to download and publish models on the huggingface.co hub

  description: |
    The `huggingface_hub` is a client library to interact with the Hugging Face Hub. 
    The Hugging Face Hub is a platform with over 35K models, 4K datasets, and 2K 
    demos in which people can easily collaborate in their ML workflows. The Hub works 
    as a central place where anyone can share, explore, discover, and experiment with 
    open-source Machine Learning.

    With `huggingface_hub`, you can easily download and upload models, extract useful 
    information from the Hub, and do much more. Some example use cases:

    - Downloading and caching files from a Hub repository.
    - Creating repositories and uploading an updated model every few epochs.
    - Extract metadata from all models that match certain criteria (e.g. models for `text-classification`).
    - List all files from a specific repository.
